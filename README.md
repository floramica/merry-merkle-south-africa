# Merry Merkle South Africa

This is an archive of impressions from December 2018 during a trip to the Wild Coast of South Africa with the African Angels Independent School.

For this annual decentralized giving initiative, we spent just under 2 weeks in rural Cintsa, building a classroom with and for the African Angels.

The campaign lasted from December 1 - 31, 2018, accepting donations in $ETH, $DAI, and $SNT.

Additionally some of the African Angels' self-portrait artworks were tokenized on SuperRare and proceeds added to the campaign.

The donation campaign in total raised R113,135 (over 48 ETH).

This was at the very bottom of a ‘bear’ crypto market, and which still covered the fees for around 24 children who started school in 2019.
